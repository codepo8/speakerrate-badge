Add a badge to your web site showing off the latest comments you received at speakerrate.com.

As requested in my tweet http://twitter.com/codepo8/statuses/5395099509 speakerrate acted very quickly and build an API for latest comments: http://twitter.com/speakerrate/statuses/5566609660 and here is my thank you.

Usage: 

Simply add a DIV with a link to your speaker page on speakerrate:

<div id="speakerratebadge">
  <a href="http://speakerrate.com/speakers/3543-christian-heilmann" id="speakerratelink">Rate me on Speakerrate</a>
</div>

Then add the script and call the init() method:

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://github.com/codepo8/speakerrate-badge/raw/master/speakerratebadge.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
speakerratebadge.init();
</script>

You can also provide a few options to the init() method to change the look and features of the badge:

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://github.com/codepo8/speakerrate-badge/raw/master/speakerratebadge.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
speakerratebadge.init(
  {
    amount:3, /* amount of comments */
    styled:true, /* Boolean if the style here should be pulled and applied */
    headerText:'Comments:' /* Text of the header above the comments */
  }
);
</script>

If you need different styles, just use styled:false or override the ones applied.

Enjoy, Chris
